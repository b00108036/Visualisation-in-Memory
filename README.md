# Visualisation-in-Memory-Analysis
Overview:
This thesis covers the process of Visualising Malware in Memory and using pattern matching machine learning algorithims to detect new similar malware variants.  

Abstract:
The huge number of obfuscated malware threats that are introduced and detected every day
has resulted in what seems like an endless cycle of attacks on individuals and organisations
worldwide. Malware authors are constantly developing and evolving obfuscation techniques
to evade anti-virus solutions, intrusion detection and other preventative systems. Previous
research in the visualisation of malware using static, dynamic or reverse engineering showed
that heavily obfuscated malware variants are not easily recognisable without first de-obfuscating
the malware. To detect obfuscated malware, this study explores the detection of obfuscated
malware families using visualisation in memory analysis.

A collection of some of the more popular malware familyâ€™s variants are examined
and visualised. The malware sample is executed, and a memory dump is captured. The
executable is extracted and converted into a grayscale image. Features are extracted from
the image and used to build a data model. Using machine pattern analysis techniques new
malware variants can then be identified as been part of a malware family.

Results show that this method is a feasible approach to aid malware researchers to
detect heavily obfuscated malware variants and to identify them as belonging to a particular
malware family
